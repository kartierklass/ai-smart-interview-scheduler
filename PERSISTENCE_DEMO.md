# 🎯 Form Persistence Demo Guide

## ✅ **Console Error Fixed!**

The React render error has been completely resolved by properly separating state updates from render cycles.

## 🧪 **How to Test Form Persistence**

### **Test 1: Basic Tab Switching**
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/dashboard
2. In "Saturn Scheduler" tab:
   - Add job description: "Senior React Developer position..."
   - Upload the sample-candidates.csv file
   - Select 2-3 interviewers
3. Switch to "Team Management" tab
4. Switch back to "Saturn Scheduler" tab
5. ✅ **All data is preserved!**

### **Test 2: Browser Refresh Recovery**
1. Fill out the complete form (job description + CSV + interviewers)
2. Press F5 to refresh the browser
3. Navigate back to /dashboard
4. ✅ **All form data is automatically restored!**

### **Test 3: Session Persistence**
1. Fill out the form completely
2. Close the browser entirely
3. Reopen browser and go to /dashboard
4. ✅ **Data persists across browser sessions!**

### **Test 4: Partial Data Recovery**
1. Add only job description
2. Switch tabs multiple times
3. Add CSV file later
4. Switch tabs again
5. Add interviewers
6. ✅ **Each change is saved incrementally!**

## 🎨 **Visual Indicators**
